display the Wiener Linien timetable for nearby bus/tram/subway lines on a
screen in the Metalab Hauptraum

Written in Javascript for use on a Raspberry Pi in Midori in Kiosk mode.

This comes with a simple JSON proxy written in PHP (see /server).

~~You need to enable cross-site requests for this to work, since I was too lazy
to implement a JSON Proxy for the Wiener Linien API, which does not allow
cross-site requests.~~

~~In case of chrome (which I use for testing on my laptop), this can be
accomplished as follows:~~
```
chrome --disable-web-security
```

Note that this is neither pretty nor finished.

Happy hacking!
